# Den Token And Faucet

This project consists of two components. The first involves
developing an ERC20 standard token by leveraging Solidity and
extending the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract such as ERC20Capped to
cap the maximum token to 10 million tokens. Ethers.js is used to
link the frontend and the smart contract. The second component
is a faucet that grants users free tokens upon their request.
