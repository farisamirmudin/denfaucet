# Den Token And Faucet

This project encompasses two components. The first involves
developing an ERC20 standard token by leveraging Solidity and
extending the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract. This token has a
maximum cap of 10 million tokens and pays block reward of 50 DEN
per transaction. Ethers.js is used for facilitating the
interaction between the frontend and the smart contract. The
second component is a faucet that grants users free tokens upon
their request.
